## About The App

nexter is a clone of Jonas Shemdit cousre advance css and sass. nexter is a website for a fictional real estate development company who are into building and selling luxurious homes.
This project focuses on how to use css-grids to build complete page layouts. I had some struggles using css grids. This project has helped me to get comfortable using css-grids with flexbox to build responsive web pages.

## Approach

I used:

- **7-in-1 folder structure architecture** for organising my files and folders
- **BEM(Block, Element, Modify)** for my class names
- **css-grids**, **flex-box** and some **media query** rules for responsive design

## Status

`Completed`.
